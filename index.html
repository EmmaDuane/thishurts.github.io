                In 2021, I transferred to the University of California, Irvine, where I've begun 
                pursing my bachelor's degree in computer science with a specialization in information. <br><br>
                
                In an effort to connect with other students and gain valuable skills, I recently joined the 
                ICSSC Fellowship offered by UCI's school of Information and Computer Science student council.
                Through this fellowship, I've been able to brush up on my web development skills and gain 
                experience using Git and React. <br><br>
                
                This quarter at UCI I'm taking classes in data management (using mySQL), OS theory,
                and human-computer interaction. Outside of the classroom, I'm creating my own webpage and 
                using online resources to learn Python. In the future, I'd love to learn more about full stack
                development, Linux, and cloud computing.

            <p>
                Before transferring to UC Irvine, I attended El Camino College. Attending community College
                gave me the time I needed to explore my interests and eventually take my first computer science
                course! During my first semester, my English professor offered me a position as a 
                tutor/teaching assistant for her class through a program called Peer-Assisted Study Sessions 
                (PASS). The director of PASS extended me an offer to tutor for other courses, which 
                is how I ended up assisting students in calculus, general physics, and entry-level 
                programming courses. Creating lesson plans and facilitating group sessions were my 
                primary responsibilities, but motivating and challenging other college students was the most
                meaningful part of this experience. <br><br>

                This Summer, I will be interning at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as a tech consulting intern. 
                I'm very excited to begin training for this position in June, and can't wait for the opportunity
                to work alongside industry professionals to provide tech solutions to PwC clientele. <br><br>

            <p>When my face isn't buried in a computer screen, it's often buried in books or comics. 
                That being said, a lot of what I love most involves being outside and around nature. 
                The photos on the right are images that I've taken on my adventures to Madrona Marsh Nature
                Preserve and the Monteray Aquarium. Photography has always provided me with an artistic 
                outlet that requires immersing myself in the world. Other hobbies of mine include painting,
                creating digital art, and caring for my many, many plants.
